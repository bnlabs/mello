# What is Mello?

Mello is a web app for screen sharing through web browser.
This service works by using the webrtc protocol and websocket to establish the connection between users. After the connection is established, streaming is peer-to-peer.

# Why was Mello created?

Mello was created to offer an alternative to Discord's screen sharing feature. While Discord's screen sharing is limited to 720p for non-Nitro users and can be unreliable at times, Mello aims to provide a more reliable solution with higher quality streaming, all available for free. The motivation behind creating Mello stems from a desire to enhance the user experience by ensuring consistency and reliability in screen sharing.
